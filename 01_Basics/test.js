// console.log("harsh")

let a = [];
console.log( a++ )
// Before console.log(a++), a is an empty array [].
// a++ increments a by 1 (which doesn't affect an empty array), returns the original value of a before the increment (which is 0 after conversion from an empty array), and prints that value (0) to the console.
